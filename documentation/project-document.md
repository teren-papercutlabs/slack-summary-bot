# Slack Article Summary Bot

## Project Overview

A Slack bot that automatically generates and posts summaries of shared articles to reduce the friction in knowledge sharing. The bot monitors specified Slack channels for article URLs, processes them through an LLM to generate summaries, and posts the summaries back to the channel, making it easier to consume shared content within the familiar Slack environment.

## Problem Statement

- Current pain points:
  - Friction in opening and reading shared articles
  - Time spent manually summarizing articles for sharing
  - Context switching between reading platforms
- Impact:
  - Reduced engagement with shared content due to friction
  - Time spent either reading full articles or creating manual summaries
  - Knowledge sharing barriers due to content consumption overhead

## Solution

- Core features:
  - Monitor specified Slack channels for bot mentions with article URLs
  - Fetch article content from provided URLs
  - Generate concise summaries using LLM processing
  - Post summaries back to the original Slack channel
- Key technical components:
  - Slack bot integration for message monitoring and posting
  - Web scraping functionality for article content extraction
  - LLM integration for summary generation
  - Content length management to handle large articles
- Technologies:
  - Node.js/TypeScript for the application
  - Slack Bot API for Slack integration
  - LLM API (specific provider TBD) for summarization
  - Winston for structured logging

## Project Scope

- In scope:

  - Slack bot implementation with channel monitoring
  - Single article URL processing and content extraction
  - LLM-based summary generation
  - Summary posting to Slack
  - Content length management and validation
  - Basic error handling and logging

- Out of scope:

  - Multi-article summarization (only one URL per message will be processed)
  - Real-time article monitoring
  - Custom summarization preferences
  - Article content caching
  - User-specific settings

- Future considerations:
  - Support for different content types beyond articles
  - Summary customization options
  - Cached responses for previously summarized articles
  - Support for additional chat platforms
  - Analytics on usage and performance
